# Wad-File-Emulator-ReloadedII

A reloaded II mod using the [File Emulation Framework](https://github.com/Sewer56/FileEmulationFramework) that emulates Danganronpa WAD files, allowing ReloadedII mods for the game that don't actually touch the physical wad files

Lots of errors will show up in the console due to terrible code in relation to the header of the emulated file, but it does work, and for now that's all I care about!
